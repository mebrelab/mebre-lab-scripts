# mebre-lab-scripts

A growing collection of reusable Python scripts for automation, analysis, verification, and experimental workflows.

This repository serves as a public workspace for small, focused tools developed over time for different purposes — ranging from research utilities to general scripting and data-related tasks.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside

Each subfolder contains an **independent script or mini-tool**, typically with its own purpose and minimal dependencies.

Examples of what you may find here:
- Authorship or metadata verification tools
- Automation and workflow helpers
- Data processing and analysis utilities
- Experimental or exploratory scripts
- One-off tools that grew useful enough to share

There is no single “application” here — think of this repo as a **toolbox**, not a monolith.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The structure may evolve, but generally follows this pattern:

mebre-lab-scripts/
├── <tool-or-topic-name>/
│ ├── script.py
│ └── README.md (optional)
├── README.md
└── LICENSE

Each folder is designed to be:
- Self-contained
- Easy to read
- Easy to reuse or adapt

---

## 🚀 Usage

Most scripts are intended to be run directly with Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
Specific requirements, inputs, or usage instructions (if any) are documented within the script itself or in a local README inside the corresponding folder.

⚠️ Notes & Disclaimer
Scripts are provided as-is, primarily for research, experimentation, or practical utility.

Output and results should be interpreted in context, especially for automated or heuristic-based tools.

Not all scripts are actively maintained once published.

🤝 Contributions
Suggestions, issues, and improvements are welcome.
If you plan to contribute something substantial, consider opening an issue first to align on scope.

### 🔥 Why this README works
- Broad enough for *any* future scripts
- Doesn’t overpromise
- Reads professional without being stiff
- Scales cleanly as the repo grows
- Looks good on profiles, CVs, and shared links

If you want next, we can:
- add a **repo philosophy section**
- write a **standard header template** you paste into every script
- or create a **subfolder README template** for consistency

This repo is gonna age really well — you’re laying the groundwork the smart way 🧱✨
